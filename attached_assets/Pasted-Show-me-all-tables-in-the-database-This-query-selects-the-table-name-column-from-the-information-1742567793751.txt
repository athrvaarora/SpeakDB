Show me all tables in the database
This query selects the 'table_name' column from the 'information_schema.tables' view where 'table_schema' is 'public'. This allows you to see all user-defined tables in the public schema of your PostgreSQL database. Given that we want to see all tables, this query is appropriate, as it retrieves the names of all tables in the public schema, which is the default schema for table users in PostgreSQL.

Select the first 10 records from [chat_messages]
The query selects all columns from the table 'chat_messages' and limits the result to the first 10 records. This satisfies the request to retrieve the first 10 records from the 'chat_messages' table. The use of 'LIMIT 10' is a standard PostgreSQL syntax to limit the number of rows returned by the query.

chat_messages
This table likely stores individual messages exchanged in various chats. Each row in this table might represent a single message, potentially including information like the message content, timestamp, sender, and other related metadata.

chats
This table potentially records chat sessions or conversations. Each entry might represent a unique chat with details such as chat participants, start time, end time, and identifiers that link to the messages in the "chat_messages" table.

These tables together suggest a structure where the chats table manages overall conversation data and the chat_messages table maintains the individual messages within those conversations. | This query retrieves the names of all tables in the current database that are part of the 'public' schema, which is typically where user-defined tables are stored in PostgreSQL.

Explanation
The empty result means that there are currently no tables present in the database. This could happen for a few reasons:
The database is newly created and no tables have been added yet.
Any existing tables may have been dropped or removed.
The query may have connected to the wrong database.
To resolve this, you might want to:

Verify that you are connected to the correct database.

Check if there are pending migrations or scripts that need to be executed to create tables.
