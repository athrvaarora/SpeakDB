Objective: Develop a Windows executable application that provides a unified natural language interface for interacting with a wide range of database systems, featuring a user-friendly workflow, chat history management, and dynamic query generation using OpenAI's GPT.

Target Audience: Users with varying levels of database expertise who need to efficiently query and manipulate data across diverse database platforms using natural language.

MVP Scope:

Extensive Database Selection and Credential Input:

The application should present a visually appealing landing page with logos and names of all supported database systems:
Relational Databases:
PostgreSQL
MySQL
SQL Server
Oracle Database
SQLite
Amazon Redshift
Google Cloud SQL
MariaDB
IBM Db2
NoSQL Databases:
MongoDB
Cassandra
Redis
Elasticsearch
DynamoDB
Couchbase
Neo4j
Data Warehouses:
Snowflake
Google BigQuery
Azure Synapse Analytics
Cloud Databases:
Azure Cosmos DB
Firestore
Time Series Databases:
InfluxDB
Upon clicking a database logo/name, the application should dynamically prompt the user for the specific credentials required for that database type.
Implement a "Test Connection" button to verify credentials.
Securely store credentials for the session.
Natural Language Chat Interface with GPT Integration & Chat History:

Implement a chat-like interface for natural language query input.
Integrate OpenAI's GPT (via API) for enhanced NLP and dynamic query generation.
Support a comprehensive range of database operations (Read, Add, Modify, Delete, Schema Exploration, Aggregation, Filtering, Sorting, Joins).
Display the generated SQL/NoSQL query to the user before execution.
Present query results in a clear, formatted manner.
Provide detailed error messages.
Implement a left-side panel for chat history management:
Display a list of previous chat sessions.
Allow users to select and revisit previous sessions.
Implement a "New Chat" button, which prompts the user to select a database and enter credentials again.
Workflow Description:

Landing Page: Users are initially presented with a landing page displaying logos and names of all supported database systems.
Database Selection: Users click on the logo/name of the database they want to query.
Credential Input: The application prompts the user for the necessary credentials for the selected database.
Chat Interface: Upon successful connection, the chat interface opens, allowing users to enter natural language queries.
Query Display: The translated SQL/NoSQL query is displayed to the user for review.
Result Display: The query results are displayed in a formatted manner.
Chat History: Users can create new chats or access previous chats via the left-side panel.
Dynamic Query Examples and Flexibility:

Provide dynamic query examples based on the selected database and schema.
Allow the application to handle variations in user phrasing and intent.
Core Functionality:

Use appropriate libraries/APIs for database connectivity.
Integrate OpenAI's GPT API for NLP and query generation.
Implement robust error handling and logging.
Windows executable application.
Technical Requirements:

Programming Language: C# or Python.
Database Connectivity Libraries: (As needed for each database)
OpenAI GPT API integration.
GUI Framework: Windows Forms, WPF, or similar.
Error handling and logging.
User Interface (UI) Considerations:

Visually appealing landing page with database logos.
Intuitive database selection and credential input.
Clear chat interface with query display and results.
User-friendly chat history management.
Testing:

Comprehensive testing with all supported databases and queries.
Testing of GPT integration and dynamic query generation.
Testing of chat history management and workflow.
Error handling and connection testing.
Deliverables:

Functional Windows executable.
Source code with comments.
User documentation.
Success Metrics:

Successful connections to all supported databases.
Accurate GPT-generated SQL/NoSQL queries.
Successful execution of complex database operations.
Positive user feedback on ease of use and chat history management.
